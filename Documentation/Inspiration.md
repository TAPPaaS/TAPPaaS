## [Proxmox Helper scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/)
We have taken inspiration and code from this project, thank you

*Why did we not just contribute to this project:* 
The helper scripts is trying ot freate a consolidated list of all possible configurations. We are trying to consolidate into a single coherent and integrated systems. So we need a subset of the scripts and some overall orchestration

## [Garage by Deuxfleur](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/)
This is perfect for Tapas: Data resiliency for everyone
We are including Garage in Tapas
The core principle and philosophy of Deuxfleurs is very alligned with Tapas

## [CASAOS](https://casaos.zimaspace.com/)
Your Personal Cloud OS

CASAOS is focused on Personal use of cloud services. Its point and click installation of many Open source product into a single environment is inspirational.

*Why did we not just contribute to this project:*
This is a "Personal" OS not an os for a comunity or business
It is focued on bringing up containers on a personal server/pc
It is not focused on creating a resilient IT backbone
It helps connect a lot of cloud services (google drive, dropbox, icloud, ...). Tapas on the other hand is focused on removing reliance of these services


## [Frappe](https://frappe.io/framework)

Frappe delivers an applicaiton framework as well as interresting business applications build on the Frappe Framework. The ease of installation of a complex applicaiton stack is inspirational. 

*Why did we not just contribute to this project:*
It is not focused on creating a resilient infrastructure platform, nor is it persuing the goal of delivering other application that already exists. As such Frappe applications on the Frappa Framework can be deployed in Tapas and become optional modules in Tapas

## [Dokku](https://dokku.com/)
Similar in goals to Frappa. as with Frappa we see Dokku as a potential module in Tapas.


## [QUBES OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
Great securit model, on Tapaas we implement something similar (trying to get it to a zero trust model). Qubes OS is aimed at the desktop, and can be a worthy alternative to Macos or windows if you care for security (as you should)

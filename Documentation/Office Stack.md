## Robust Self-Hosted Open Source Software Stack for Office Suite (Proxmox-based, Zero Trust)

**Goal:** Deliver an Office365-like user experience—privacy-friendly, secure, and fully self-hosted.

---

### 1. Core Infrastructure

- **Proxmox:** Use for virtualization; split your server into logical VMs/LXC containers (e.g., Nextcloud, Formbricks, Headscale, OPNsense).
- **OPNsense:** Open source firewall/router as a virtual appliance before your internal network (or DMZ). Manages network segmentation, VLANs, NAT, firewall rules, VPN, and IDS/IPS.

---

### 2. Zero Trust Network Access

- **Headscale (or Tailscale):** Self-hosted mesh VPN for secure access to internal services without opening ports. User-friendly (one-click, direct access to all needed apps, similar to a corporate network).
- **Alternatives/Supplements:**
  - **Pomerium** or **Pritunl Zero:** Identity-aware reverse proxies for application-level access control, SSO integration, and fine-grained policies—no traditional VPN needed.
  - **NetBird:** WireGuard-based zero trust overlay, similar to Tailscale/Headscale.

---

### 3. Identity & Authentication

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
  - Connect Nextcloud to a central identity provider such as Authentik, Keycloak, JumpCloud, or existing Azure AD/Google Workspace.
  - Users log in everywhere with one account (Office365-like experience).
- **2FA:** Enable two-factor authentication in Nextcloud and your IdP for maximum security.

---

### 4. Essential Applications

- **Nextcloud:** File sharing, collaboration, calendar, contacts.
- **ONLYOFFICE/Collabora:** Office suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint alternative).
- **Nextcloud Talk:** Chat/video calls.
- **Formbricks:** Surveys and forms.
- **Project Management:** Consider Plane, Vikunja, or OpenProject as Jira/Planner alternatives.
- **CryptPad (optional):** End-to-end encrypted online notes and collaboration.

---

### 5. Security & Monitoring

- **IDS/IPS:** Enable Suricata or Zeek on OPNsense for network monitoring.
- **Fail2ban:** Protect Nextcloud/SSH from brute-force attacks.
- **Backups:** Automate backups of VMs/data to an external location (preferably offsite).
- **Monitoring:** Use Netdata, Grafana, or Prometheus for performance and availability insights.
- **Automatic updates/security patching:** Set up for your Linux VMs and containers.

---

### 6. Network Segmentation & DMZ

- **DMZ:** Place public-facing services (like Nextcloud, if directly internet-accessible) in a separate network segment. OPNsense manages firewalling between DMZ, internal, and external networks.
- **Zero Trust:** With Headscale/Tailscale or Pomerium, you can keep services secure even without a DMZ, as they're not directly exposed to the internet.

---

### 7. User Experience Optimization

- **SSO & device onboarding:** Keep sign-up simple (preferably QR code or magic link).
- **Mobile and desktop clients:** Provide clear instructions for Nextcloud, Office, and VPN.
- **Self-service:** Let users reset passwords and manage devices via your IdP.

### 8. Overview of Must-Have Software

| Function                | Recommended Software           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Virtualization          | Proxmox                       |
| Firewall/router         | OPNsense                      |
| Zero trust network      | Headscale/Tailscale/NetBird   |
| Identity & SSO          | Authentik, Keycloak, JumpCloud|
| File sharing & Office   | Nextcloud + ONLYOFFICE/Collabora|
| Surveys                 | Formbricks                    |
| Chat/video calls        | Nextcloud Talk                |
| Project management      | Plane, Vikunja, OpenProject   |
| Monitoring              | Netdata, Grafana, Prometheus  |
| Backup                  | Borg, Restic, Proxmox Backup  |
| IDS/IPS                 | Suricata, Zeek (via OPNsense) |
| Brute force protection  | Fail2ban                      |

### Practical Next Steps

1. Deploy OPNsense as a virtual firewall in Proxmox.
2. Segment your network (DMZ, internal, possibly guest).
3. Set up Headscale/NetBird for zero trust access.
4. Set up SSO (e.g., Authentik + Nextcloud integration).
5. Deploy Nextcloud, Office, Formbricks, and other apps as separate VMs/containers.
6. Automate backups and monitoring.
7. Test user experience and optimize as needed.

**Tip:**  
This stack is modular—start with the essentials (Nextcloud, Office, SSO, firewall), then expand with surveys, project management, and advanced monitoring as your needs grow.

Digital sovereignty means that an organization, government, or country has control over its digital infrastructure, data, and the way that data is stored, processed, and protected. It’s about being able to make independent decisions regarding digital matters without relying on foreign parties or technologies subject to other countries’ laws.

# The essence in simple terms

## 	Being in control of your own data and IT
You decide where your data is stored, who can access it, and under which rules.

## Protection against external interference
You prevent other countries or companies (for example, through foreign laws like the US Cloud Act) from accessing your data without permission.

## Complying with local laws
You ensure your digital processes and storage meet the regulations of your own country or region, such as GDPR in Europe.


# Why is digital sovereignty important?
	•	Protecting privacy and business secrets
	•	National security and economic stability
	•	Building trust with customers and partners
	•	Avoiding dependence on foreign tech giants

# Universal pattern and analogy
Think of digital sovereignty as having a safe in your own home instead of a bank abroad. You hold the key, decide who enters, and set the rules.

# Practical aspects

Digital sovereignty depends on:
	•	Where your data physically resides (location and jurisdiction)
	•	Who supplies your technology (local or foreign provider)
	•	How much control you have over access, processing, and security of your data
	•	Whether you can easily switch providers (portability and interoperability)

# IT for my Home

This is the documentation for the IT4Home project
Project is still VERY Draft

In its simple form it is documentation on what I want to implement in my home to run all my stuff, control all my electronics and generally make my home "smart"

However we believe that the state of the home automation and the direction our digital lives take us, is increasingly making us puppets of large corporations that do not have our interests as priority one (or two or three, ...). So this is about taking back control. THis is described further in the [Manifesto](./Manifesto.md) and [Vision](./Vision.md) document

Just to make it clear what we mean by a Home we have defined this [Home](./Home.md)

The rest is really standard Architecture work that is: Define a capability model, map this to an implementation model and then go from there.

[TODO](./TODO.md) is just a random and incomplete list of stuff that needs to be addressed

## Definition of a Home

Most people have an idea on what a Home is. However the definition is very dependent on the context. As this project is about IT for Homes then it would be appropriate to define what we man by Home.

Here are some definitions:

- A place that you own or rent
- The place you go an sleep when not on vacation
- The place you live together with you family
- A house or an Apartment

For this project it is all of the above, and also a place where you can set your own rules and standard for how to live (typically within some limitation of whatever jurisdiction the Home is in)

For this project I often think about the home as a word for my Private universe. Separate from my Corporate universe, and separate from the Public space.  Extending from this, and very important for the project, is that a Home is now both a Physical and a Virtual construct.

- I might invite guests into my home. They are then under my rules, and generally my friends and relatives understand this. In the same manner I might invite friends into my virtual Home to share holiday pictures.
- The physical home is something that I have selected very carefully and are constantly "sculpting" to my desire. I upgrade my kitchen, I paint the walls and I cultivate my garden. I do it for my own pleasure but also as a way of projecting my self to friends, family and the general society. The virtual home should also be under my control and allow me to model my appearance and functionality
- The physical home in my definition include all it's "content" such as furniture, pictures on the walls, books and other stuff on the bookshelf, you tool collection. Your car in the garage, your bicycles (yes I have several bicycles, I live in Denmark).
- For the Virtual Home it include among many thinks items like:
  - your private email, address book
  - you private papers like insurance policies, bank statements, tax filings, pay slips
  - You private picture and video library
  - you ebooks, music, movie, podcast library

## Definition of IT for a Home

IT4HOME is all the information technology that is (or should be) in my physical physical home to realize my virtual home.

- all internet connected devices in your home
- tech used to "run" your virtual home and mange you private data and identities.

# IT for my Community

If you are a collection of related IT4HOME users then you can form a community

This can either be neighbors  or a village or friends or extended family

The community provide:

- Backup service for each other
- Community services that are shared
- Community networking (if physically reasonably close together)

## Stuff to document

### Backup service:

- make other IT4HOME servers be backup for each other
- create a dedicated large Community back up server (storing backups encrypted)

### Community Services:

running a Mastodon service
local DNS across the community
local library service (local instance of wikipedia, ....)

#### Community networking:

Most IT systems in homes tend to stop working if the Internet is down. A lot can be achieved with running a well configured DNS that would work for local services in times of outage. 

However if we hook up with the local community, we can create a redundant local network. with a few internet connection and running at the virtual edge you get
- redundancy
- cheaper connectivity
- local community connectivity when the larger internet is down

This assume you have local routing and dns. and it require familiarity with OSPF

The Community could also host a DNS authoritative nameserver network

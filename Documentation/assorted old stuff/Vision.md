Realize the Manifesto by building a local IT infrastructure that take back control. 

Build it using using generic hardware and open source

Select best in class open source projects, and select configurations that just work.

Package it so that it is easy to install and configure, even for someone that is not a super IT geek

Drive the selection of tools and configurations based on "Requirements". in other words be clear on the needs of the system. Do not implement because "you can" but because you "want/need it"

### I own my data.

- My pictures are owned by me, and should be available to my kids, and grand kids 50 years from now no matter what service provider they have and what mobile phone or compute or tablets or VR headset they own
- My emails are private and should not be owned by a company
- My house configurations are owned by me
- My data should be stored in open formats that do not rely on proprietary codex
- My e-books and podcasts and music downloads are owned by me and should not be reliant on a cloud service that might disappear in 5, 10, 20 years

### I own my devices

My TV talk to a Korean company that pushes SW updates and adverts. my Microwave want to serve me with recipes and track my usage (well it is not as I have blocked that), my Fridge want to talk with a server so that I can remotely control the temperature (why do I need that), the list goes on, is increasingly depending on internet connection and cloud service. I want to ensure my devices work in 2 years from now and is not suddenly bricked because a vendor think they control my devices.

### My home should work without connectivity

My home should be seamless managed, no need for an expensive consultant to install, upgrade, patch, fix. And it should work when the internet is down. When I press the light switch the light should come on regardless of the state of the rest of the world. 

### Let us Fix the Internet

The internet was designed as a connection of local nets. The IP protocols were invented with the design goal of having no central point of failure.

With the advent of large hyper scalers we increasingly rely on these companies manage our information technology and associated virtual homes. Those companies do have the resources to create a very fault tolerant and secure environment with deep integration across the services they offer, however it does imply that you are giving up your freedom of choice, and  you are essentially moving from an interaction form of many to many to centralized hup and spoke approach.

You can compare the centralized approach of hyper scalers with the original distributed and open standards approach of the internet to what it would look like in the physical world:

- **Centralized approach**: There is one mall in town, is only one mall , you can only get what is in that mall. You are actively discouraged from dining at home, and there is only one way of meeting with friends: go to the mall, as this is also the only transport available.
- **Distributed approach to Cities and homes:**  You can chose what food to buy, what friend to invite, how to move around, where to dine out, with or without friends

## Using an Organization Name as Repository Owner on GitHub
You can absolutely have a GitHub repository owned by an organization instead of a private person. Here’s how it works and what you need:

### How it works
	•	Organizations are special GitHub accounts designed for teams, companies, or projects—not for individuals.
	•	When you create a repository under an organization, the organization is listed as the owner, not a private person.
	•	You manage access and roles for team members within the organization, assigning permissions as needed.

### Steps to set up an organization as repository owner
	1.	Create a personal GitHub account (if you don’t already have one).
	2.	Create an organization account:
	•	Go to GitHub, click the “+” icon (top right), and select “New organization.”
	•	Choose a name for your organization and complete the setup.
	3.	Create repositories under the organization:
	•	When creating a new repository, select your organization as the owner instead of your personal account.
	•	The repository will now be owned and managed by the organization.

### Key points
	•	You don’t need a separate email or identity for the organization—just create it from your personal account.
	•	You can invite others to join the organization and assign them roles (member, admin, owner).
	•	Ownership and access: The organization “owns” the repository, and you manage who can access or administer it via organization settings.
	•	Legal/copyright ownership: GitHub’s organization ownership is about platform control, not legal copyright—actual copyright depends on your agreements and licenses.

### Practical tip
If you already have a repository under your personal account, you can transfer it to your organization as long as you have permission to create repositories in that organization.

Summary:
Yes, you can simply create an organization account on GitHub and use it as the owner of repositories, ensuring the organization name—not an individual—is listed as the owner.






## To create a GitHub organization as a business or institution, you need the following:
1. A Personal GitHub Account
	•	You must be signed in with your own GitHub account to create an organization.
2. Organization Details
	•	Choose “A business or institution” during setup.
	•	Enter the name of your business or institution (e.g., tappaas.org). This is for identification and does not require you to prove ownership at this stage.
3. Organization Name Availability
	•	The organization name (the one that will appear in the URL, e.g., github.com/tappaas) must be unique and not already used by another user or organization.
	•	If your personal account uses the same name, you cannot use that name for the organization unless you first change or delete your personal username.
4. Billing Email
	•	You will be asked to provide a billing email address for the organization, even if you use the free plan.
5. (Optional) Domain Verification
	•	If you want your organization to display a “Verified” badge (for extra trust and to confirm your identity), you can later verify your domain by adding a DNS TXT record to your domain’s DNS settings.
	•	This step is optional unless you specifically want the “Verified” status.
6. Inviting Team Members
	•	After creation, you can invite others to join your organization and assign them roles (member, admin, etc.).
Summary:
You can create an organization account for your business or institution directly from your personal GitHub account. You only need to provide the organization name, a billing email, and basic info. Domain verification is optional but recommended for public trust. The organization will then own repositories, not you as a private person.
If you want the organization to be clearly linked to your business (e.g., tappaas.org), consider verifying your domain after setup for extra credibility.


## You can change a GitHub organization’s name after you’ve started using it.
To do this:
	1.	Go to your organization’s Settings (click your profile photo in the top right, select “Your organizations,” then pick the organization and go to Settings).
	2.	Scroll down to the Danger zone section.
	3.	Click Rename organization.
	4.	Follow the prompts, read the warnings, and confirm the new name.
What happens after renaming:
	•	GitHub automatically redirects links to your repositories, so existing web links will continue to work for a while.
	•	Your old organization name becomes available for others to claim, so update your remote URLs and external links as soon as possible.
	•	Some links, like your organization profile page and API requests, will not redirect and will return a 404 error if not updated.
	•	If you have public packages or popular container images, some names may be permanently retired to prevent confusion.
Tip:
Changing only the display name does not affect the URL. You must use the “Rename organization” option in the Danger zone to change the actual organization URL.
It may take a few minutes for the change to take effect.

## Robust Self-Hosted Open Source Software Stack for Office Suite (Proxmox-based, Zero Trust)

**Goal:** Deliver an Office365-like user experience—privacy-friendly, secure, and fully self-hosted.

---

### 1. Core Infrastructure

- **[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/):** Use for virtualization; split your server into logical VMs/LXC containers (e.g., Nextcloud, Formbricks, Headscale, OPNsense).
- **[OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/):** Open source firewall/router as a virtual appliance before your internal network (or DMZ). Manages network segmentation, VLANs, NAT, firewall rules, VPN, and IDS/IPS.

---

### 2. Zero Trust Network Access

- **[Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale)** (or [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)): Self-hosted mesh VPN for secure access to internal services without opening ports. User-friendly (one-click, direct access to all needed apps, similar to a corporate network).
- **Alternatives/Supplements:**
  - **[Pomerium](https://www.pomerium.com/)** or **[Pritunl Zero](https://zero.pritunl.com/):** Identity-aware reverse proxies for application-level access control, SSO integration, and fine-grained policies—no traditional VPN needed.
  - **[NetBird](https://netbird.io/):** WireGuard-based zero trust overlay, similar to Tailscale/Headscale.

---

### 3. Identity & Authentication

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
  - Use **[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)** as your central identity provider.
  - Connect Nextcloud and other apps to Keycloak for unified login (Office365-like experience).
- **2FA:** Enable two-factor authentication in Nextcloud and Keycloak for maximum security.

---

### 4. Essential Applications

- **[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/):** File sharing, collaboration, calendar, contacts.
- **[ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) / [Collabora Online](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/):** Office suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint alternative).
- **[Nextcloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/):** Chat/video calls.
- **[Formbricks](https://formbricks.com/):** Surveys and forms.
- **Project Management:** Consider [Plane](https://plane.so/), [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io/), or [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) as Jira/Planner alternatives.
- **[CryptPad](https://cryptpad.org/)** (optional): End-to-end encrypted online notes and collaboration.

---

### 5. Security & Monitoring

- **IDS/IPS:** Enable [Suricata](https://suricata.io/) or [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) on OPNsense for network monitoring.
- **[Fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page):** Protect Nextcloud/SSH from brute-force attacks.
- **Backups:** Automate backups of VMs/data to an external location (preferably offsite) using [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/), [Restic](https://restic.net/), or [Proxmox Backup Server](https://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-backup-server).
- **Monitoring:** Use [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for performance and availability insights.
- **Automatic updates/security patching:** Set up for your Linux VMs and containers.

---

### 6. Network Segmentation & DMZ

- **DMZ:** Place public-facing services (like Nextcloud, if directly internet-accessible) in a separate network segment. OPNsense manages firewalling between DMZ, internal, and external networks.
- **Zero Trust:** With Headscale/Tailscale or Pomerium, you can keep services secure even without a DMZ, as they're not directly exposed to the internet.

---

### 7. User Experience Optimization

- **SSO & device onboarding:** Keep sign-up simple (preferably QR code or magic link).
- **Mobile and desktop clients:** Provide clear instructions for Nextcloud, Office, and VPN.
- **Self-service:** Let users reset passwords and manage devices via Keycloak.

### Practical Next Steps

1. Deploy OPNsense as a virtual firewall in Proxmox.
2. Segment your network (DMZ, internal, possibly guest).
3. Set up Headscale/NetBird for zero trust access.
4. Set up SSO with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and integrate with Nextcloud and other apps.
5. Deploy Nextcloud, Office, Formbricks, and other apps as separate VMs/containers.
6. Automate backups and monitoring.
7. Test user experience and optimize as needed.

---

**Tip:**  
This stack is modular—start with the essentials (Nextcloud, Office, SSO, firewall), then expand with surveys, project management, and advanced monitoring as your needs grow.

# Design your TAPPaaS system

Note this is not about the design of TAPPaaS itself but how to design your instance of TAPPaaS

There are 4 steps involved:

- Identify what problem you expect your TAPPaaS system should do
- Size the installation: how much compute and storage is needed, what will the Network look like
- Define and allocate/procure the Hardware needed
- Capture some essential information needed for standing up TAPPaaS

# Identifying the problem:

look at the examples in [Examples folder](../Examples/README.md)

# Sizing

Define the services running and add up the needed resources
number of Servers
size of tank 1 and tank 2 on each
amount of Network

# Capture essential information for your TAPPaaS

- name the servers
- define where stuff should reside if multiple servers

# The stack

TAPaaS follows a fully standard approach to with a seperation into three layers

- Applicaiton layer: deployment specific with a catalogue of common applicaitons needed for many deployments
- Platform Layer: core services needed to support the applicaiton layer
- Infrastructure: physical and virtualisation
This is complemented with selfmanagement, and cloud services

# Network Implementation

# Platform service implementations



# Infrastructure implementations

Primary software:

- Proxmox: compute and storage virtualisation
- OPNsense: network routing and firewalling

# Hardware configurations

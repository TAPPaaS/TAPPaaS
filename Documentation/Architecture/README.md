# Introducing the TAPPaaS Architecture

The TAPPaaS architecture has its starting point in defining the [Capabilities](Capabilities.md) that TAPPaaS will deliver
We then map the capabilities to a [Software Stack](TheSoftwareStack.md) of open source applications

For some of the selected applications we have dedicated design documents as the implementation is not straight forward, and design decisions needs to be made

These are:

- The [Network](NetworkDesign.md) design: This is primarily being delivered via OPNsense and Proxmox as well as the switching infrastructure
- The [Storage](StorageDesign.md) design: This is delivered via Proxmox, but require a dedicated design discussion

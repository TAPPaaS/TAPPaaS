# Installation of TAPPaaS

Creating and managing a TAPPaaS system has the following major steps

- [Design your system](Design.md): Define your requirement and based on that allocate the right Hardware
- [Bootstrap your TAPPaaS](../src/Foundation/README.md): Get the basis software installed to allow you to manage TAPPaaS in through a dedicated virtual TAPPaaS CI/CD service running on the first TAPPaaS node
- Configure your TAPPaaS: configure the different services you want to run. How to do this will be explained when you have bootstrapped the first TAPPaaS node/server
- Run the TAPPaaS CI/CD Automation. Note that in the early phases of TAPPaaS there will be manual steps to complete for many of the modules.

Once the TAPPaaS system is up and running there is ongoing maintenance
- regularly run the TAPPaaS update scripts 
- Health monitoring

You can also verify the configuration using AI, based on the recipe in: 

- [Compliance Report version a](./EvB_TAPPaaS%20compliance%20report.md)
- [Compliance Report version b](TAPPaaS%20-%20AI%20assisted%20compliance%20report.md)

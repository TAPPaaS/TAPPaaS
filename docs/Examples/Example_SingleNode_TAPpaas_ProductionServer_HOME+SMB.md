# Robust, Power-Efficient, and Enterprise-Grade TAP-PaaS Node Design  
## Storage & Network Architecture for Home and SMB Workloads (2025)

---

## **Essence**
This design delivers a robust, reliable, and high-performing TAP-PaaS node, suitable for home and SMB workloads (Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, Home Assistant, automation, light virtualization).  
It combines best practices for **storage** and **networking**—with redundancy, security, and scalability at its core.

---

## **Key Design Principles**

- **Redundancy & Reliability:** Mirrored storage, ECC memory, and VLAN segmentation protect data, uptime, and security.
- **Power Efficiency:** Low energy use, quiet operation, and minimal heat for home/office.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Use proven, affordable components; avoid overprovisioning.
- **Balanced Performance:** All resources (CPU, RAM, network, storage) are sized for 15–25 users and future growth.
- **Enterprise-Grade Networking:** VLANs, subnetting, and segmentation for security, manageability, and scalability.

### **Network Topology Overview**

- **Internet → Firewall → Switch(es)**
- Switches trunk all VLANs.
- Each VLAN is mapped to a subnet (e.g., VLAN 30 = 10.0.30.0/24).
- Core services (e.g., Proxmox, OPNsense, storage) are placed in dedicated VLANs for security and management.
- IoT, media, guest, and camera devices are strictly isolated.

---

### **Best Practices and Rationale**

- **Never use VLAN 1 for production.**
- **Align VLAN IDs with subnet third octet** for clarity (e.g., VLAN 30 = 10.0.30.0/24).
- **Group IoT and media** unless you have a large/high-value environment.
- **Use 10.0.x.x/24 subnets** for flexibility and to avoid conflicts with consumer gear.
- **Secure trunk ports, enable 802.1Q tagging, and use strong firewalling.**
- **Automate documentation and change management** (use Git, NetBox, Ansible).
- **Regularly audit VLANs, firewall rules, and logs.**
- **Enable QoS on Voice VLAN, disable unused ports, and use 2FA for admin access.**

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **This design provides robust, redundant, and secure storage and networking for a single TAP-PaaS node.**
- **Supports 15–25 users, modern collaboration, and automation tools.**
- **Scalable, future-proof, and based on enterprise and advanced home lab best practices.**

## **Recommended Hardware Configuration**

| **Component**              | **Recommended Model/Type**                            | **Rationale**                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chassis**                | Mini-ITX/1U rackmount or small tower                 | Compact, quiet, fits home/SOHO; easy to cool and maintain.                                         |
| **Motherboard**            | Supermicro A2SDi-8C+-HLN4F or similar                | 8-core Atom C3758 (25W), 4x DIMM, 12x SATA, IPMI, 4x 1GbE, M.2 slot; proven reliability.           |
| **CPU**                    | Intel Atom C3758 or Xeon-D (8+ cores, low TDP)       | Efficient, enough for 15–25 users, VMs, Docker, automation, and light AI tasks.                    |
| **RAM**                    | 64GB ECC UDIMM (4x16GB or 2x32GB)                    | Plenty for ZFS ARC, VMs, containers, and caching; ECC for data integrity.                          |
| **Boot/System SSDs**       | 2x Intel S3500/S3610 240GB (Enterprise SATA, Mirror) | Enterprise reliability for OS/hypervisor; keeps system root isolated and easy to recover.          |
| **Main Data Pool SSDs**    | 2x Samsung 870 EVO or Crucial MX500 2–4TB (Mirror)   | ZFS mirror for redundancy; robust, fast, and cost-effective for user data and VMs.                 |
| **NVMe SSD (optional)**    | Samsung 970 Pro or WD SN850X 500GB–1TB               | Use as fast pool for high-IOPS VMs, scratch data, or as ZFS L2ARC (read cache) if needed.          |
| **Backup HDD**             | WD Red or Seagate IronWolf 1TB+                      | For local backups, snapshots, and archival storage; cost-effective, reliable.                      |
| **Networking**             | 4x 1GbE onboard (or add 10GbE SFP+ if needed)        | Sufficient for most SMB/home; 10GbE optional for future-proofing or heavy file transfers.          |
| **Power Supply**           | 80+ Platinum-rated, 150–300W                         | High efficiency, low idle draw, quiet operation.                                                   |
| **Case Fans**              | Noctua or equivalent low-noise, PWM fans             | Quiet, reliable cooling.                                                                           |
| **UPS**                    | APC or Eaton 500–1000VA                              | Protects against power loss, ensures graceful shutdown.                                            |

## **Why This Setup?**

- **Performance:**  
  - SSD mirror saturates 1GbE/2.5GbE; handles 15–25 active users for Nextcloud/OnlyOffice with fast boot and low latency.
  - NVMe is only needed for high-IOPS or latency-sensitive workloads; most users won’t notice the difference for file serving or web apps.
  - Atom C3758 is efficient yet powerful enough for virtualization, automation, and typical SMB/home use.

- **Redundancy & Reliability:**  
  - ZFS mirror (RAID1) protects against single SSD failure.
  - ECC RAM guards against memory corruption.
  - Enterprise SSDs for OS/boot ensure high uptime and fast recovery.
  - Regular off-site or cloud backups recommended for disaster recovery.

- **Power Efficiency:**  
  - System idle power: 20–30W (without spinning disks).
  - Quiet operation, suitable for home/office.
  - Atom or Xeon-D CPUs offer excellent performance-per-watt.

- **Cost-Effectiveness:**  
  - Consumer SATA SSDs (870 EVO, MX500) offer high endurance and great value.
  - Enterprise SSDs for boot/system are affordable on the used market.
  - Avoids over-investment in NVMe unless your workload justifies it.

## **Expected System Performance**

| **Workload**                        | **Performance**                                   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sequential Read/Write (SSD Mirror)   | ~500–550 MB/s (SATA limit, mirrored)              |
| Random IOPS (SSD Mirror)             | 80,000–100,000                                    |
| NVMe Pool (if used)                  | Up to 3500 MB/s read, 2700 MB/s write, >400,000 IOPS |
| VM/LXC Responsiveness                | Fast boot, low latency, suitable for 15–25 users  |
| Power Consumption (idle/load)        | 20–30W idle, 40–60W typical load                  |

---

## **Storage Pool Usage & Best Practice**

- **Enterprise SSD Mirror:**  
  OS/boot, firewall, critical configs (RAID1 for resilience)
- **SSD Mirror:**  
  Main data pool for VMs, containers, Nextcloud, OnlyOffice, automation, and user data
- **NVMe:**  
  High-IOPS, latency-sensitive VMs/containers, or as ZFS L2ARC cache (optional, only if RAM is saturated)
- **HDD:**  
  Local backup, snapshots, archive/cold storage

---

## **NVMe as ZFS Cache: When & Why**

- **Use NVMe as L2ARC (read cache) only if:**
  - Your working set exceeds RAM (64GB) and you see frequent cache misses.
  - Your workload is large, random, and read-heavy (rare in SMB/home).
- **Do not use consumer NVMe (like Samsung 970 Pro) as SLOG/ZIL** (write cache) unless it has power-loss protection (PLP).

---

## **Upgrade & Expansion Tips**

- Add 10GbE NIC if you need faster LAN file transfers or future-proofing.
- Expand RAM to 128GB+ for larger VM/automation workloads.
- Add more SATA SSDs or HDDs for additional storage or backup targets.

# TAP-PaaS Node: Secure, Automated, Privacy-Respecting Single Node Design  
## For Home/SMB Office and Home Automation Workloads (2025)

---

## **Design Overview**

This summary consolidates all key design considerations and recommendations for a robust, high-performing, and secure single-node TAP-PaaS production server. The design supports modern home/SMB office workloads and home automation, with built-in trust, automation, and privacy by design.

**Key principle:**  
The automation stack (Git, OpenTofu, Ansible) should be kept logically—and, where feasible, physically or virtually—separate from application services. This supports best practices in infrastructure-as-code (IaC), DevSecOps, and compliance.

## **Core Principles**

- **Trust & Security:**  
  Segregate networks and services using VLANs, strict firewalling, and least-privilege access.
- **Automation:**  
  Automate configuration, deployment, and documentation for repeatability and rapid recovery.
- **Privacy:**  
  Use open-source, self-hosted identity and access management (Keycloak), zero-trust access (Pangolin, Headscale), and strict segmentation of user, device, and management networks.
- **Performance & Resilience:**  
  Use mirrored SSDs for critical workloads, NVMe for high-IOPS tasks, and HDDs for backups. Segment acceptance and production environments.
- **Clarity & Scalability:**  
  Use clear VLAN numbering, 10.0.x.x/24 subnets, and leave space for future growth.

## **Key Recommendations and Best Practices**

### 1. **Strict Separation for Automation Stack**
- Place Git, OpenTofu, and Ansible in a dedicated VLAN (e.g., VLAN 25).
- Restrict network/API access from automation runners to only what is required.
- Store infrastructure code in a separate Git repository.
- Use isolated CI/CD runners; firewall rules should restrict automation-to-production access.
- All automation actions must be logged, auditable, and secrets encrypted.

### 2. **Service Segmentation**
- Shared services (Home Assistant, SearxNG) live in VLAN 30, accessible via firewall rules.
- Management (Proxmox, OPNsense, UniFi) is isolated in VLAN 10.
- IAM (Keycloak) is in the DMZ (VLAN 20) with strict access controls.
- Pangolin and Headscale (remote access) are in VLAN 15.
- IoT/media devices are isolated in VLAN 60.

### 3. **Storage Assignment**
- Mirrored SSDs (ZFS mirror) for all critical data/services.
- NVMe for high-IOPS, non-critical, or temporary workloads.
- HDD for backups and archives.
- Segment storage pools for acceptance/test and production/live workloads.

### 4. **Security, Privacy, and Automation**
- Enforce least privilege and zero-trust principles.
- Regularly audit VLAN assignments, firewall rules, and logs.
- Use open-source IAM (Keycloak) for privacy and control.
- Automate configuration and documentation for repeatability and auditability.

### 5. **Scalability & Future-Proofing**
- Leave gaps in VLAN numbering for future expansion.
- Use 10.0.x.x/24 subnetting for clarity and scalability.
- Design storage and network for easy scaling as needs grow.

## **How to Use This Design**

1. **Bootstrap:**  
   - Deploy management and hypervisor tools in isolated VLANs.
   - Configure core network segmentation and firewalling.
2. **Acceptance/Test:**  
   - Validate all workloads in acceptance VLANs/storage pools before moving to production.
   - Use automation for repeatable, auditable deployments.
3. **Production:**  
   - Deploy office suite, automation, and DMZ services in their respective VLANs.
   - Enforce privacy and security with IAM, zero-trust access, and strict segmentation.
   - Use robust, redundant storage for all critical data.
4. **Ongoing Operations:**  
   - Use NVMe for high-IOPS or temporary workloads.
   - Store all backups and archives on HDD.
   - Regularly audit, monitor, and update all configurations.

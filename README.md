# TAPPaaS

The Automated/Application Platform as a (selfhosted) Service

pronounced Tapas, and associated with tapas as a delicious dish combining a lot of smaller servinges

Goal:
Creating a fully automated and maintaned platform that can serve
- SMB that needs cost control
- Goverment institutions that needs resiliense
- Home and Community services that needs privacy and ownership of data
 
Ensure that the platform is selfcontained, and will function without reliance of the larger internet.

A design Goal is to use existing Open Source as much as possible: Reuse instead of reinvent

Another design goal is to REDUCE flexability. There is value in design and deploy decitions having been taken up front. It does imply that some use case will not fit to Tappas, but for what fits it will be much easier

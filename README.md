# TAPPaaS

Trusted - Automated - Private Platform as a (self hosted) Service

pronounced "tapas", and associated with the food "tapas" as a delicious dish combining a lot of smaller servings. A community inspired initiative under motto - every one needs a cloud in their basement. 

Goal:

Creating a fully automated and maintained platform that can serve

- SMB that needs for cost control
- Government and NGO institutions that needs resilience
- Home's and Communities that needs privacy and ownership of data
 
Ensure that the platform is self contained, and will function without reliance of the larger internet.

It is free and open source so that there can be no hidden fees or price hikes

A design Goal is to use existing Open Source as much as possible: Reuse instead of reinvent

Another key design goal is to REDUCE flexibility. There is value in design and deploy decisions having been taken up front. It does imply that some use case will not fit to TAPPaaS, but for what fits it will be much easier

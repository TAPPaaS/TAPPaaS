# TAPPaaS

Trusted - Automated - Private Platform as a (self hosted) Service

pronounced Tapas, and associated with tapas as a delicious dish combining a lot of smaller servings. A community inspired initiative under motto - sharing is caring. 

Goal:
Creating a fully automated and maintained platform that can serve
- SMB that needs cost control
- Government institutions that needs resilience
- Home and Community services that needs privacy and ownership of data
 
Ensure that the platform is self contained, and will function without reliance of the larger internet.

A design Goal is to use existing Open Source as much as possible: Reuse instead of reinvent

Another design goal is to REDUCE flexibility. There is value in design and deploy decisions having been taken up front. It does imply that some use case will not fit to TAPPaaS, but for what fits it will be much easier

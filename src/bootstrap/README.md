# Bootstraping TAPPaaS

This directory contains Three scripts (and some helper scripts)

1) TAPaaSPostPVEInstall.sh: this do basic household activities on Proxmox after initial install
2) TAPaaSBootstrap.sh: this create and install a selfmanage VM with all the needed tooling
3) TAPPaaS-CICD-bootstrap.sh: a script to be run inside the CICD VM

After bootstraping then all management is done inside the CICD VM

## how to bootstrap

See the Bootstrap.md in the Documentation directory
